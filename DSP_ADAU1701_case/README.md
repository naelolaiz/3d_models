## Fixes top panel
- [ ] USB-C hole is too narrow. Connector doesn't pass case.
- [ ] PCB separation: since the bottom is not consuming the PCB height, it should be consumed in the top panel (create a difference with a PCB so the holes are separated.
- [ ] DIP-switch + momentarly switches holes should be moved ~ 2mm to the 1x10 connector side (the dip switch is the worst located one)
- [ ] 1x3 jumper in the daughter PCB should also be moved ~ 2mm to the same side. Maybe just move the daughter PCB position reference to that side to move everything?
